This project consists of my first end to end project written in C# with WPF (XAML)
The intent was to build a customizable flashcard application and I completed all my initial objectives
I did have to set aside my stretch goals but I was proud to have completed the project with my current set of skills in the week we had to complete it.
I still have much to learn but really enjoyed the process.
